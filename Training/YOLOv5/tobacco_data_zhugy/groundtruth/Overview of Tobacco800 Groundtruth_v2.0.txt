Overview of Tobacco800 Groundtruth Version 2.0

The groundtruth of the Tobacco800 document image database was created by the Language and Media Processing Laboratory, University of Maryland. This new release includes the groundtruth information on both signatures and logos in this large complex document image collection. 

Including the location and dimensions of each visual entity, the XML groundtruth v2.0 also contains the true identity of each signature instance, enabling evaluation of signature matching and authorship attribution.
